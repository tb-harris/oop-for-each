# For Each and Assignment Operators

## Multiply.java
*   **Problem:** Write a Java program that multiplies all of the command line arguments provided by the user.
*   **Command Line Arguments:** `<num1> <num2> <num3> ...`
*   **Expected Output:** The product of the numbers you provided is __.
*   **Hint:** Use a for loop to iterate through the arguments and multiply them together.

## Average.java
*   **Problem:** Write a Java program that calculates the average of the parameters provided by the user.
*   **Command Line Arguments:** `<num1> <num2> <num3> ...`
*   **Expected Output:** The average of the numbers you provided is __.
*  **Hint:** Use a for loop to iterate through the arguments and add them to a sum variable. Divide the sum by the number of arguments to get the average.

## GPACalc.java
*   **Problem:** Write a Java program that calculates the GPA of a student based on the letter grades calculated by the user. A is worth 4.0, B is worth 3.0, C is worth 2.0, D is worth 1.0, and F is worth 0.0.
*   **Command Line Arguments:** `<grade1> <grade2> <grade3> ...`
*   **Expected Output:** Your GPA is __.
*   **Hint:** Use a for loop to iterate through the arguments, and an if-else if-else statement to add the corresponding GPA value to a sum variable. Divide the sum by the number of arguments to get the average.

## NumOdd.java
*   **Problem:** Write a Java program that counts the number of odd numbers in the command line arguments provided by the user.
*   **Command Line Arguments:** `<num1> <num2> <num3> ...`
*   **Expected Output:** The number of odd numbers you provided is __.
*   **Hint:** Use a for loop to iterate through the arguments and an if statement to check if each number is odd. Keep track of the total using a variable.

## Challenge: Max.java
*   **Problem:** Write a Java program that finds the maximum number in the command line arguments provided by the user.
*   **Command Line Arguments:** `<num1> <num2> <num3> ...`
*   **Expected Output:** The maximum number you provided is __.

## Challenge: StandardDeviation.java
*   **Problem:** Research the formula for calculating the standard deviation of a set of numbers. Write a program that calculates the standard deviation of the command line arguments provided by the user.
*   **Command Line Arguments:** `<num1> <num2> <num3> ...`
